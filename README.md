## JS PROJECT DESCRIPTIONS:

<h2>Calculator</h2>

<p>A basic 4 operator calculator. This simple but sleek web calculator can be used to add, subtract, multiply, and divide. It was built with HTML, CSS, and JS</p>

<br>

<h2>Tic-Tac-Toe Game</h2>

<p>A simple but classic game of tic-tac-toe. This is a user vs PC, RNG game. The program places tolkens at random. The game has audio effects and customized tolkens for each player instead of the usual X's and O's.</p>

<br>

<h2>Pizza Menu</h2>

<p>This project is a simple pizza menu that allows the user to simulate building and purchasing pizzas with different topping choices. It takes user input and calculates a price for the order based on what was selected.</p>
